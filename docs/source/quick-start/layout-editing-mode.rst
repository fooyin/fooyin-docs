Layout Editing Mode
====================

In **Layout Editing Mode**, the entire interface can be customised, and a new layout built from scratch. This mode primarily uses the right mouse button to interact with widgets.

To enter Layout Editing Mode, toggle it using ``Layout->Editing Mode``. Once enabled, widgets can be interacted with using right-click. The editing context menu usually features two sections:

1. The widget directly under the cursor.
2. The parent splitter of the above widget (if applicable).
