Interface
==========

One of fooyin's main features is its customisable layout. Several preset layouts are included to help you get started, but you're encouraged to design your own to suit your specific needs.

Layouts can be built from scratch by entering the **Layout Editing Mode**, where you can insert, remove, move, and split widgets as desired. If you make a mistake while editing, use ``Edit->Undo`` or press ``Ctrl+Z`` to undo the action.
